Data.gov.au is the central source of Australian open government data.

Anyone can access the anonymised public data published by federal, state and local government agencies.

You are encouraged to search and reuse the data on data.gov.au. This data is a national resource that holds considerable value for growing the economy, improving service delivery and transforming policy outcomes.

Find out more [about open data](https://blog.data.gov.au/about-open-data).

In addition to government data, you can also find publicly-funded research data and datasets from private institutions that are in the public interest.

The site has over 30,000 publically available datasets and continues to grow. The federal government’s <a href="https://www.pmc.gov.au/resource-centre/data/australian-government-public-data-policy-statement" target="_blank">public data policy statement<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a> requires all government agencies to make non-sensitive data open by default.

In addition to free, open datasets, data.gov.au now includes information about unpublished data and data available for purchase.

### Visualising data

Many of the data sets can be visualised using the in-built mapping tools.

Datasets that contain a geospatial field (such as latitude and longitude)can be mapped and viewed in <a href="http://nationalmap.gov.au/" target="_blank">NationalMap<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a>.

### Contact us

### How do I register or upload data

Anyone can [register an account](https://data.gov.au/user/register) on data.gov.au which can be used for commenting or liking datasets.

But to publish government data you must have an account with an Australian Government email address (ending with “.gov.au”).

Before you consider registering an account for a government (federal, state, local) or government-funded research agency, you should do a quick search of existing [organisations](https://search.data.gov.au/organisations) to see if your own agency is already listed. The listed contact can help you to log in and publish your data sets. If not, you can register for the first time.

### Development

Data.gov.au was transferred from the Department of Premier and Cabinet to the Digital Transformation Agency (DTA). The redeveloped platform MAGDA was developed in  partnership with CSIRO <a href="http://data61.csiro.au" target="_blank">Data61<span class="visuallyhidden"> Opens in new window</span></a>.

MAGDA (Making Australian Government Data Available) is a fully open source project.
